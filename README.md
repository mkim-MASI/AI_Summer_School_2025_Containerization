üê≥ Containerization Tutorial
This tutorial will walk you through creating, running, and exploring a Docker container.

0Ô∏è‚É£ Install Docker Desktop
If you don‚Äôt already have Docker installed:

Windows / macOS: Download Docker Desktop and follow the setup instructions.

Linux: Install Docker Engine for your distribution.

To verify your installation:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker --version
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Docker image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t my-tutorial-image .
-t my-tutorial-image gives the image a name.

. tells Docker to use the Dockerfile in the current directory.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Docker container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run --name my-tutorial-container my-tutorial-image
--name my-tutorial-container names your container.

This command runs the container based on the image we just built.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Shell into the Docker container
You can open an interactive shell inside the container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it my-tutorial-container /bin/bash
From here, try:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls
You should see the files that were copied into the container from the repository.
